Repository contains [Eclipse Che](https://github.com/eclipse/che) [devfile](https://redhat-developer.github.io/devfile/) which could be used for creating an Eclipse Che workspace for development of the eduke32 project.

It provides development environment which allows to develop, build and run the project.

However, there are some limitations:
 - Only software render is available
 - No sound

TODOs:
 - Add C++ language tools plug-in when ready
 - Add ability to configure password for remote desktop
